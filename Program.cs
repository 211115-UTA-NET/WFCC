// Exercise 1 – Fizz Buzz 
// Complete the function below so that it takes 4 integer parameters(start, end, divisor1, and divisor2) 
// and when invoked loops from the start value to the end value inclusive and for each number in that range adds to a 
// list a value based on the following set of rules: 

// 1) If the value is evenly divisible by divisor1 then add "Fizz" 
// 2) If the value is evenly divisible by divisor2 then add "Buzz" 
// 3) If the value is evenly divisible by both divisor1 and divisor2 then add "FizzBuzz" 
// 4) If the value is not evenly divisible by either divisor then add the value itself. 



// Exercise 2 – Word Count 
// Complete the function below so that it will take a string of text as input and return an object the keys of which 
// will be the distinct words from the text and the value will be the count of the number of times that word was 
// encountered in the text. Your function should be case insensitive so that, for example, "dog" and "Dog" would be 
// treated as the same word. The resulting object keys should all be in lowercase. 

// So if you invoke this function: 
// WordCount("Four score and seven years ago the score was tied four to four in inning number seven") 
// Then returns the list.



//Exercise 3 – String Shuffle 
//Complete the function below so that it takes three string parameters(str1, str2, and str3) and returns a boolean 
//indicating if the final string parameter is a valid shuffle of the first two. A valid shuffle is one where the third 
//string can be formed by interleaving the characters of the first two while maintaining the left to right ordering of 
//the characters from each. 

//If you invoke this function: 
//IsValidShuffle("abc", "def", "dabecf") the expected response is true 
//If you invoke this function: 
//IsValidShuffle("abc", "def", "bdacef") the expected response is false
